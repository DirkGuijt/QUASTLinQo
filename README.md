Well, this is the original LinQo progam as it was used by Gentlemens Club Q.U.A.S.T. on the 22nd of May 2013. Be advised: This code was written in a very short amount of time so it might hurt your brain when reading through it. Also,  we are not responsible for any disputes on the rules of this game or any bugs that may start fights when playing the game.

If you want to expand the rich feature set of this program, then please create your own branch and do a pull request when finished working.

**Please share your LinQo story if you are going to use this implementation. You can do that here: [issue #1](https://github.com/DirkGuijt/QUASTLinQo/issues/1)**

Disclaimer:
The current word list was not created by me so sorry for all the bad language. We played it at a student fraternity... Also, please give some credit to me and QUAST when using this game for your own cool linQo activity! We appreciate that!
